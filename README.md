## To Setup Locally

- This project uses Bun as its package manager. You need to have Bun installed on your system.
- To install Bun, follow the official guide at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenieWizards/finance-management-api.git # Clone the repo
cd finance-management-api # Navigate to the cloned folder
bun install # Install necessary dependencies using Bun package manager
bun dev # Start the server in development mode
```

## üê≥ Docker Development Setup

This project uses Docker for both development and production environments. Below are the instructions to get started.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Make (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)

### Available Make Commands

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Development Commands
make dev-build    # Build development environment
make dev-up       # Start development environment
make dev-down     # Stop development environment

# Production Commands
make build        # Build production environment
make up           # Start production environment
make down         # Stop production environment
make restart      # Restart the application

# Utility Commands
make logs         # View logs from all containers
make ps           # List running containers
make shell        # Open a shell in the API container
make migrate      # Run database migrations
make clean        # Stop containers, remove volumes, and prune system
```

### Quick Start (Development)

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   make dev-build
   make dev-up
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8998`

### Development Notes

- The development environment includes hot reloading. Any changes to the source code will automatically reflect in the running application.
- When adding new dependencies (`bun add <package>`), you'll need to rebuild the containers:
  ```bash
  make dev-down
  make dev-build
  make dev-up
  ```

### Database

- PostgreSQL is available at `localhost:5432`
- Default credentials (development):
  ```
  User: root
  Password: root
  Database: finance-management-api-dev
  ```
- Migrations are run automatically when the container starts

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Clean Docker resources:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

2. Rebuild everything:

   ```bash
   make rebuild
   ```

3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   make logs
   ```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

```bash
make build
make up
```

Note: Make sure to set appropriate environment variables for production use.

## Check API Documentation

- The API documentation is available at {{API_URL}}/reference

## Database Migrations

If the schema is added/updated, you need to generate and apply the migrations:

```bash
bun db:generate # Generates the migration
bun db:migrate # Applies the migration
```
